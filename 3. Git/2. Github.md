## Github Basics

Github is a hosting platform for git repositories. You can put your own Git repos on Github and access them from anywhere and share them with people around the world.

Beyond hosting repos, Github also provides additional collaboration features that are not native to Git(but are super useful). Bascially, Github helps people share and collaborate on repos.

### More About Github

#### Collaboration

If you ever plan on working on a project with at least one other person, Github will make your life easier! Whether you're building a hobby project with your friend or you're collaborating with the entire world, Github is essential!

#### Open Source Projects

Today Github is THE home of open source projects on the Internet. Projects ranging from React to Swift are hosted on Github.

#### Exposure

Your Github profile showcases your own projects and contributions to others' projects.

It can act as a sort of resum√© that many employers will consult in the hiring process. Additionally, you can gain some clout on the platform for creating or contributing to popular projects.

#### Stay Up To Date

Being active on Github is the best way to stay up to date with the projects and tools you rely on. Learn about upcoming changes and the decisions/debate behind them.

### Cloning

So far we've created our own Git repositories from scratch, but often we want to get a **local copy of an existing repository** instead.

To do this, we can clone a remote repository hosted on Github or similar websites. All we need is a URL that we can tell Git to clone for use.

### git clone

- To clone a repo, simply run **git clone < url >**
- Git will retrieve all the files associated with the repository and will copy them to your local machine.
- In addition, Git initializes a new repository on your machine, giving you access to the full Git history of the cloned project.

**Anyone can clone a repository from Github**, provided the repo is public. You do not need to be an owner or collaborator to clone the repo locally to your machine. You just need the URL from Github.

### SSH Keys

You need to be authenticated on Github to do certain operations, like pushing up code from your local machine. Your terminal will prompt you every single time for your Github email and password, unless...

You generate and configure an SSH key! Once configured, you can connect to Github without having to supply your username/password.

### How Do I get My code on Github?

#### Option 1: Existing Repo

If you already have an existing repo locally that you want to get on Github...

- Create a new repo on Github
- Connect your local repo (add a remote)
- Push up your changes to Github

#### Option 2: Start From Scratch

If you haven't begun work on your local repo, you can...

- Create a brand new repo on Github
- Clone it down to your machine
- Do some work locally
- Push up your changes to Github

### Pushing

To get your own changes and Git history up on Github, we need to PUSH them up. The typical workflow looks something like this:

- Make some changes locally
- Add and commit those changes
- Repeat...
- Push new commits up to Github

### Remote

Before we can push anything up to Github, we need to tell Git about our remote repository on Github. We need to setup a "destination" to push up to.

In Git, we refer to these "destinations" as **remotes** . Each remote is simply a URL where a hosted repository lives.

#### Viewing Remotes

To view any existing remotes for you repository, we can run **git remote** or **git remote -v** (verbose, for more info)

This just displays a list of remotes. If you haven't added any remotes yet, you won't see anything!

#### Adding a new Remote

A remote is really two things: a URL and a label.

```
git remote add <name> <url>
```

To add a new remote, we need to provide both to Git.

```
git remote add origin https://github.com/blah/repo.git
```

Okay Git, anytime I use the name "origin", I'm referring to this particular Github repo URL.

#### Origin

**Origin** is a conventional Git remote name, but it is not at all special. Its just a name for URL.

When we clone a Github repo, the default remote name setup for us is called origin. You can change it or leave as it is.

#### Checking our Work

Try viewing your remotes with **git remote -v**, and you should now see a remote showing up!

Remember by setting up a remote we are just telling Git about a remote repository URL.We have not "communicated" with the Github repo at all yet.

Other Commands are not commonly used, but there are commands to rename and delete remotes if needed.

```
git remote rename <old> <new>

git remote remove <name>
```

### Git Push

Now that we have a remote set up, let's push some work up to Github! To do this, we need to use the `git push` command.

```
git push  <remote> <branch>
```

We need to specify the remote we want to push up to AND the specific local branch we want to push up to that remote.

#### Example of git push

git push origin master tells git to push up the master branch to our origin remote.

```
git push origin master
```

#### Push In Detail

While we often want to push a local branch up to a remote branch of the same name, we don't have to!

```
git push <remote>  <local-branch>:<remote-branch>
```

To push our local pancake branch up to a remote branch called waffle we could do:

```
git push origin pancake:waffle
```

### The -u option

The -u option allows us to set the upstream of the branch we're pushing You can think of this as a link connecting our local branch to a branch on Github.

Running **git push -u origin master** sets the upstream of the local master branch so that it tracks the master branch on the origin repo.

**Note**: Once we've set the upstream for a branch, we can use the `git push` shorthand which will push our current branch to the upstream.

## Fetching and Pulling

### Remote Tracking Branches

<img src="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/images/remote-branches-1.png">

**orgin/master** is a remote branch, It's a reference to the state of the master branch on the remote. I can't move this myself. It's like a bookmark pointing to the last known commit on the master branch on origin.

#### Remote Branches

Once you've cloned a repository, we have all the data and Git history for the project at that moment in time. However, that does not mean it's all in my workspace!

The github repo has a branch called **puppies**, but when I run **git branch** I don't see it on my machine! All I see is the master branch. What's going on?

For above scenario, Run **`git branch -r`** to view the remote branches our local repository knows about.

#### More About Local and Remote Bracnh

Suppose I just cloned github Repo named Animals.

- By default, my master branch is already tracking origin/master.
- If I want to work on the puppies branch locally!.
  I Could `checkout origin/puppies`, but that puts me in detached HEAD.
- If i want my own local branch called puppies, and I want it to be connected to origin/puppies, just like my local master branch is connected to origin/master.

Run **`git switch <remote-branch-name>`** to create a new local branch from the remote branch of the same name.

`git switch puppies` makes me a local puppies branch AND sets it up to track the remote branch origin/puppies.

**Note**: the new command git switch makes this super easy to do!, It used to be slightly more complicated using **git checkout**

```
  git checkout --track origin/puppies
```

### Git Fetch

**Fetching** allows us to download changes from a remote repository,But those changes will not be automatically integrated into our working files.

It lets you see what others have been working on, without having to merge those changes into your local repo.

Think of it as "please go and get the latest information from Github, but don't screw up my working directory."

The **`git fetch <remote>`** command fethces branches and history from a specific remote repository.It only updates remote tracking branches.

**`git fetch origin`** would fetch all changes from the origin remote repository.

We can also fetch a specific branch from a remote using **`git fetch <remote> <branch>`**

For example, git fetch origin master would retrieve the latest information from the master branch on the origin remote repository

### Git Pull

**`git pull`** is another command we can use to retrieve changes from a remote repository. Unlike fetch, pull actually updates our HEAD branch with whatever changes are retrieved from the remote.

To pull, we specify the particular remote and branch we want to pull using **`git pull <remote> <branch>`**. Just like with git merge, it matters WHERE we run this command from. Whatever branch we run it from is where the changes will be merged into.

**`git pull origin master`** would fetch the latest information from the origin's master branch and merge those changes into our current branch.

**Note**: Pull can result in merge conflicts :(

#### Short Syntax for git pull

If we run git pull without specifying a particular remote or branch to pull from, git assumes the following:

- remote will default to origin
- branch will default to whatever tracking connection is configured for your current branch.

**Note**: <p style="color:green">this behavior can be configured, and tracking connections can be changed manually. Most people dont mess with that stuff. </p>

## Github Odds & Ends

### READMEs

A README file is used to communicate important information about a repository including:

- What the project does
- How to run the project
- Why it's noteworthy
- Who maintains the project

If you put a README in the root of your project, Github will recognize it and automatically display it on the repo's home page.

READMEs are Markdown files, ending with the .md extension. Markdown is a convenient syntax to generate formatted text. It's easy to pick up!

### Github Gists

Github Gists are a simple way to share code snippets and useful fragments with others. Gists are much easier to create, but offer far fewer features than a typical Github repository.

### Github Pages

Gitub Pages are public webpages that are hosted and published via Github. They allow you to create a website simply by pushing your code to Github.

Github Pages is a hosting service for static webpages, so it does not support server-side code like Python, Ruby, or Node. Just HTML/CSS/JS!

- You get one user site per Github account. This is where you could host a portfolio site or some form of personal website. The default url is based on your Github username, following this pattern: **username.github.io** though you can change this!
- You get unlimited project sites! Each Github repo can have a corresponding hosted website. It's as simple as telling Github which specific branch contains the web content. The default urls follow this pattern: **username.github.io/repo-name**

## Git Collaboration Workflows

### Centralized Workflow

- AKA Everyone Works On Master/Main
- AKA The Most Basic Workflow Possible

The simplest collaborative workflow is to have everyone work on the master branch (or main, or any other SINGLE branch).

It's straightforward and can work for tiny teams, but it has quite a few shortcomings!

#### Problems with Centralized Workflows

While it's nice and easy to only work on the master branch, this leads to some serious issues on teams!

- Lots of time spent resolving conflicts and merging code, especially as team size scales up.
- No one can work on anything without disturbing the main codebase. How do you try adding something radically different in? How do you experiment?
- The only way to collaborate on a feature together with another teammate is to push incomplete code to master. Other teammates now have broken code...

### Feature Branches

Rather than working directly on master/main, all new development should be done on separate branches!

- Treat master/main branch as the official project history
- Multiple teammates can collaborate on a single feature and share code back and forth without polluting the master/main branch
- Master/main branch won't contain broken code (or at least, it won't unless someone messes up)

#### Feature Branch Naming

There are many different approaches for naming feature branches. Often you'll see branch names that include slashes like **bug/fix-scroll** or **feature/login-form** or **feat/button/enable-pointer-events**

Specific teams and projects usually have their own branch naming conventions. To keep these slides simple and concise, I'm just going to ignore those best-practices for now.

### Merging in Feature Branches

At some point new the work on feature branches will need to be merged in to the master branch!

There are a couple of options for how to do this...

1. Merge at will, without any sort of discussion with teammates. JUST DO IT WHENEVER YOU WANT.

2. Send an email or chat message or something to your team to discuss if the changes should be merged in.

3. **Pull Requests!**

### Pull Requests

Pull Requests are a feature built in to products like Github & Bitbucket. They are not native to Git itself.

They allow developers to alert team-members to new work that needs to be reviewed. They provide a mechanism to approve or reject the work on a given branch. They also help facilitate discussion and feedback on the specified commits.

<p style="color:green">"I have this new stuff I want to merge in to the master branch...what do you all think about it?"</p>

#### Pull Request Workflow

1. Do some work locally on a feature branch
2. Push up the feature branch to Github
3. Open a pull request using the feature branch just pushed up to Github
4. Wait for the PR to be approved and merged. Start a discussion on the PR. This part depends on the team structure.

#### Note about Merging Conflicts

Just like any other merge, sometimes there are conflicts that need to be resolved when merging a pull request.

You can perform the merge and fix the conflicts on the command line like normal, or you can use Github's interactive editor.

for eg: In my local machnine I can merge the branch and resolve the conflicts locally...

- Switch to the branch in question. Merge in master and resolve the conflicts.

```
git fetch origin
git switch my-new-feature
git merge master
```

- Switch to master. Merge in the feature branch (now with no conflicts). Push changes up to Github.

```
git switch master
git merge my-new-feature
git push origin master
```

Even Github gives the instructions if you forget What to do!

When merging, we can perform a _Squash & Merge_ which will reduce all the commits from the feature branch down into a single commit on master.

#### Configuring Branch Protection Rules

In Github, We can secure the main by applying branch protection rules which are under settings of the repository.This Rules are generally used by large scale projects so that anyone in the team will not harm the main branch directly.Now for any feature development or bugfix you need to create a branch work on it and push it and then get reviewed by co-workers/leads after that only we'll be able to merge.

#### Recaping Pull Requests

Pull Requests are a fancy way of requesting changes from one branch be merged into another branch.

Tools like Github & Bitbucket allow us to generate pull requests via an online interface. Team members can then view the changes and decide to merge them in or reject them. PR's also provide a place to discuss the changes and provide feedback.

### Fork & Clone: Another Workflow

The "fork & clone" workflow is different from anything we've seen so far. Instead of just one centralized Github repository, every developer has their own Github repository in addition to the "main" repo. Developers make changes and push to their own forks before making pull requests.

It's very commonly used on large open-source projects where there may be thousands of contributors with only a couple maintainers.

#### Forking

Github (and similar tools) allow us to create personal copies of other peoples' repositories. We call those copies a "fork" of the original.

When we fork a repo, we're basically asking Github "Make me my own copy of this repo please"

As with pull requests, forking is not a Git feature. The ability to fork is implemented by Github.

Now that I've forked, I have my very own copy of the repo where I can do whatever I want!

I can clone my fork and make changes, add features, and break things without fear of disturbing the original repository.

If I do want to share my work, I can make a pull request from my fork to the original repo.

#### Summary of forking

1. I fork the original project repo on Github
2. I clone my fork to my local machine
3. I add a remote pointing to the original project repo. This remote is often named upstream.
4. I make changes and add/commit on a feature branch on my local machine
5. I push up my new feature branch to my forked repo (usually called origin)
6. I open a pull request to the original project repo containing the new work on my forked repo
7. Hopefully the pull request is accepted and my changes are merged in!
